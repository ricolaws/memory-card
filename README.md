## Overview

![Screen Shot 2021-09-27 at 11 45 38 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41934323/134967195-3034407d-533e-470f-986d-8c9be85c01a0.png)

- This is my version of the card game "memory", built in vanilla JS.
- I used this as an opportunity to implement some game logic in JS, try out a technique for scrolling text, and to experiment with 3D CSS. 

### Built With

- JAVASCRIPT
- CSS
- HTML

## Features

 - The cards are three dimensional objects that flip over when you click on them. 
 - The cat delivers the game instructions with a "typewriter" effect inspired by old video games.
 - It looks cute.

## How to Play

The objective is to find all the pairs of matching cards. To start, just click on a card, then guess where it's match is and click there too. Listen to the cat.
